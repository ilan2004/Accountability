## Environment Variables

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Appearing
- Check console for errors
- Ensure WhatsApp is not already linked to 4 devices
- Restart the service

### Connection Issues

- Check internet connection
- Clear auth state and re-authenticate if needed

### Message Not Sending

## Migration from whatsapp-web.js
